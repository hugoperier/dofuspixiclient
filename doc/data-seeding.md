# Data seeding

## What the migrations do

`apps/gameserver-ts/migrations/` holds 40 Kysely migrations. They create the
schema and seed **static game data**: spell templates and levels (from the
lang bundle, 0039), spell→visual mappings (from
`assets/sources/starloco/sorts.sql`, 0041), breed spell positions, tutorial
content, achievements, item and monster scaffolding.

Run them with `just db-migrate`, inspect with `just db-status`.

## What they deliberately leave empty

Per-deployment tables stay empty, and three of them are load-bearing:

| Table | Consequence when empty |
|---|---|
| `game_servers` | The server list comes back empty — login dead-ends on the server-select screen |
| `accounts` | Nothing to log in as |
| `players` (+ `player_stats`) | The character-select screen is a dead end |
| `maps` | `enter-game: map not found id=10300` — see *Importing the world* below |

**Character creation is not implemented** — there is no create-character
screen in the client and no server feature behind it. Until it exists, the
rows have to be written by hand.

## `just db-seed`

`apps/gameserver-ts/scripts/dev-seed.ts` writes a minimal playable set. It is
idempotent — every row is upserted — and takes optional arguments:

```bash
cd apps/gameserver-ts
bun run scripts/dev-seed.ts [username] [password] [character]   # defaults: dev dev Dev
```

It creates:

- **`game_servers` id 1**, `state = 1`. State must be `1` (online) or the
  server list filters it out.
- **`accounts`**, with `pwd_hash = argon2(PBKDF2(password))` — see the login
  section of [architecture.md](architecture.md). Hashing the plaintext
  password authenticates nothing.
- **`players` + `player_stats` + `player_colors`.** `select-character`
  INNER JOINs `player_stats`, so a character without a stats row is listed but
  cannot be selected.
- **`player_spells`**, copied from `spell_templates`. Migration 0036 does this
  with a cross join, but it runs before any player exists, so a hand-seeded
  character would otherwise have an empty spellbook.
- **`maps` id 10300** — *only if absent*, see below.

### A second account (two-player testing)

The seed writes one account per run and is keyed on `accounts.username` /
(`server_id`, `players.name`), so running it again with different arguments
adds a second account and character rather than replacing the first:

```bash
cd apps/gameserver-ts
SPAWN_MAP_ID=7410 CHARACTER_CLASS=8 \
  bun run scripts/dev-seed.ts dev2 dev2 Dev2
```

`CHARACTER_CLASS` (1..12, the 1.29 breed ids — 1 Féca, 8 Iop, 9 Crâ…) and
`CHARACTER_SEX` (0 male, 1 female) pick the class and the sprite
(`gfx = class * 10 + sex`); without them the second character is another
Féca with the same sprite as the first, which makes it hard to tell the two
apart on screen. The spellbook follows the class through `class_spells`.

Point `SPAWN_MAP_ID` at the map the first character is standing on to have
them meet straight away:

```bash
docker exec dofuspixiclient-postgres-1 psql -U dofus -d dofus \
  -c "SELECT name, map_id, cell_id FROM players"
```

Both clients then connect to the same gateway, and two tabs of
`just client-web` are enough: the client keeps no login state in browser
storage (only keybinding overrides live in `localStorage`), so each tab
authenticates over its own WebSocket.

### Spawn cell

The schema's default spawn is `map_id = 10300, cell_id = 319`, and **319 is
not walkable on that map**. `src/core/modules/maps/spawn-point.ts` decodes
`maps.cells` (the StarLoco HASH_CELL payload, via
`src/core/modules/maps/maps.cells-codec.ts`) and picks the walkable cell
nearest the middle of the diamond — cell ids start at the top corner, which
is usually off the top of the viewport. The seed and the admin API below
share that function, so a seeded and a provisioned character wake up the
same way.

### The placeholder map

If the spawn map has no row at all, the seed inserts a **blank walkable
placeholder** so `enter-game` succeeds, and says so. It is a bare test room —
prefer importing the real world, below. The seed never touches an existing
map row.

## `just dev-accounts` — connexion rapide from the login screen

Typing `dev` / `dev` a hundred times a day is a tax, and the twelve
level-200 validation characters
(`scripts/seed-combat-validation.ts`, accounts `retro-validation-01`…`-12`)
are worse: their password only exists in whoever ran the fixture's shell
history.

`just dev-accounts` reads every locally seeded account it recognises, and
writes `dev-accounts.json` at the repository root:

```bash
COMBAT_VALIDATION_PASSWORD=… just dev-accounts
#   Dev — dev
#   Féca 200 — retro-validation-01
#   …
```

The dev client's login screen then shows one button per account under the
form, and a click walks the whole flow — sign in, pick the server, pick the
character — straight into the game.

Three things about it are deliberate:

- **It stores the derived key, not the password.** That base64 key is what
  `AccountSendIdentity` puts on the wire anyway, so it grants nothing
  extra, it keeps a password you may have reused off disk, and it makes
  the click instant: the 600 000 PBKDF2 rounds are paid once, at
  generation.
- **Every key is verified against `accounts.pwd_hash` before it is
  written.** A wrong `COMBAT_VALIDATION_PASSWORD` fails at generation,
  named account by named account, instead of producing thirteen buttons
  that all answer "bad credentials".
- **It cannot ship.** The file is gitignored, and it is served by a Vite
  dev-server middleware (`/__dev-accounts`) that does not exist in a
  build. A production bundle has no route, no file, and
  `loadQuickConnectRoster` returns an empty list — the strip renders
  nothing.

Re-run it after re-seeding; the roster is a snapshot, not a subscription.
Passwords come from the environment: `DEV_PASSWORD` (default `dev`) and
`COMBAT_VALIDATION_PASSWORD` (no default, same variable the validation
fixture itself requires). An account whose password is not in the
environment is skipped and named on stdout.

## `POST /admin/accounts` — provisioning without a shell (QA-126)

The seed script needs a checkout and a database handle. An external control
plane (DofBotConsole) has neither, so the gateway exposes the same job over
HTTP. The route exists **only when `GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set**, and the
gateway then also needs `DATABASE_URL` — it refuses to boot with one and not
the other.

Locally both live in **`apps/gameserver-ts/.env`** — Bun loads it on its own
and all three processes run from that directory. `DATABASE_URL` is already
there (see `.env.example`), so the token is the only line to add:

```dotenv
GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me
```

In containers, `docker-compose.yml` already hands `DATABASE_URL` to the
`gateway` service and reads the token from the shell environment or from a
`.env` **at the repository root** — the one Docker Compose reads, not
`apps/gameserver-ts/.env`:

```dotenv
# ./.env
GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me
```

Or with no file at all:

```bash
GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN=… DATABASE_URL=postgres://dofus:dofus@localhost:5432/dofus \
  bun run src/gateway/main.ts
```

```http
POST /admin/accounts
X-Admin-Token: <secret>
Idempotency-Key: <uuid>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "bot-astrub-01",
  "passwordKey": "<base64 PBKDF2-SHA256, 32 bytes>",
  "pseudo": "Bot Astrub 01",
  "serverId": 1,
  "character": { "name": "BotAstrub", "breedId": 8, "sex": 1 }
}
```

`passwordKey` is what the *client* sends at login, not the password:
PBKDF2-SHA256, 600 000 iterations, salt `sha256("dofus:" + lowercase
username)`, 32 bytes, canonical base64. The plaintext never reaches the
server, and the derived key is never stored or logged in the clear —
`accounts.pwd_hash` is an argon2 hash of it, exactly as `db-seed` writes it.
`serverId` may be omitted when exactly one server is online.

One call creates the account, its `account_servers` row, the character, its
stats, colours and class spellbook — in **one transaction**. `201` on
creation, `200` when the same `Idempotency-Key` and body are replayed, and
the ids come back either way:

```json
{ "account": { "id": "101", "username": "bot-astrub-01" },
  "character": { "id": "202", "name": "BotAstrub" } }
```

Refusals are `{ "error": "<stable code>", "message": "…" }`:

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `400` | malformed JSON, or a missing/oversized `Idempotency-Key` |
| `403` | missing or wrong `X-Admin-Token` |
| `409` | `username_taken`, `pseudo_taken`, `character_name_taken`, `idempotency_key_reuse` (same key, different body) |
| `413` | body over 8 KiB |
| `422` | `invalid_request`, `invalid_password_key`, `unknown_server`, `no_server_available`, `server_required` |
| `429` | more than 20 calls a minute from one caller |

The rules live in
`src/core/features/auth/provision-account/provision-account.service.ts`; the
route is a translator over it, and `dev-seed.ts` composes the same
primitives. Neither the admin token nor the password key ever appears in a
log line, an error message or a response.

## Importing the world

`maps.cells` — the walkability/ground/object payload the server sends on
enter-game — has no in-repo source. StarLoco publishes its full game database,
and its `maps` table carries the same HASH_CELL payload this project decodes:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StarLoco/StarLoco-Game/master/game.sql
just import-maps game.sql
```

(Or `just import-world game.sql` for geometry, contents and triggers in one go
— see [What makes the world actionable](#what-makes-the-world-actionable).)

`just import-world` also ends by exporting the public navigation projection
from the imported tables. Rebuild it independently with
`just export-navigation`; it writes
`apps/electrobun/public/assets/data/navigation-manifest.json` and its JSON
Schema. See [contracts.md](contracts.md) for the format and compatibility
handshake.

That writes 9 358 maps, 265 subareas, 9 358 fight-placement rows and 36 219
neighbour links.

Two things the importer
(`apps/gameserver-ts/scripts/import-starloco-maps.ts`) has to get right:

- **Half the maps are ciphered.** StarLoco stores some `mapData` as plain
  HASH_CELL and some as hex ciphered under the row's `key`. You cannot tell
  them apart by character set — hex digits are valid HASH_CELL characters —
  so the discriminator is length against the expected cell count. Deciphering
  is a port of StarLoco's `CryptManager.decryptMapData`.
- **A Dofus map does not have `width × height × 2` cells.** The grid is a
  diamond: `(height - 1) × (2·width - 1) + width`. A 15×17 map is 479 cells,
  not 510.

Positions, subareas and fight-placement cells are deliberately *not* taken
from the dump: StarLoco targets 1.39.8 while this project targets 1.29, and
the 1.29 truth already ships in the repo as `MA` in
`apps/electrobun/public/assets/langs/fr/maps.json`. The dump's own
`mappos`/`places` are the fallback for maps the lang bundle does not list.
(Both sources agree where they overlap — verified on map 10300.)

Two of the 9 360 rows are skipped: their payload decodes to the wrong cell
count under either interpretation.

### Neighbour links

`map_neighbors` answers "the player just walked off the north side — which map
is that?". Nothing in the schema or the dump fills it, so without it walking
off a map does nothing at all. The importer derives the links from world
coordinates (x grows east, y grows south), with two guards:

- Coordinates only compare inside one superarea — Amakna and Incarnam each
  have their own grid.
- About half of all positions are shared by several maps, because interiors
  stack on the position of their building. One map per position is elected to
  represent it, by **area first, then per-cell ground tiles, then id**.

  Electing on *edge-cell count* looks obvious and is wrong: a small house
  interior whose floor runs to the border of its diamond has more walkable
  edge cells than the street outside it — 48 against 34 at Astrub (2, -18) —
  so walking east off the street teleported the player into the house, where
  there is no edge link back out. Size and ground coverage separate the two
  cleanly: the street is 15x17 with 210 ground tiles, the house 9x12 with 9.

  Better still, run `just import-map-swf <Client/data/maps>` first: it writes
  the retail `maps.outdoor` flag, which settles the election outright and lets
  the importer refuse to link into an interior at all. With it, no neighbour
  link points at an indoor map; the size/ground rule is only the fallback for
  maps it has not covered.

Of the 35 890 links, 27 946 are traversable end to end. 7 442 are inert — the
departure side has no walkable cell on that edge, so nothing ever triggers
them. The remaining 502 have an exit but no walkable landing spot on the far
side; `resolveLandingCell` refuses those and logs a warning, leaving the player
where they stand rather than stranding them.

### What makes the world actionable

`just import-triggers game.sql` (chained into `just import-world` after
`import-maps`) fills the four tables that decide whether anything in the world
answers a click. All four sat empty until it existed, which is why no door,
bank or zaap did anything at all.

```
scripted cells: 23 726          interactive object templates: 197
waypoints: 33 zaaps + 75 zaapis houses: 1 050 (815 enterable), 1 092 doors
```

- **`scripted_cells`** is the dump's own table, minus the 4 rows whose action
  is not a teleport and the 65 that name a map this database does not have.
  StarLoco has no `verb` column — actions 0, 979 and 1 all carry `mapId,cellId`
  arguments and all import as `TP`. This is what a *public* building's door is
  in 1.29: not a clickable object, a walkable cell carrying a teleport.

  These rows also cover a scattering of map-edge crossings, and
  `ScriptedCellsService` short-circuits `maybeCrossEdge` — so where a row
  exists it now outranks the neighbour election above. That is deliberate: the
  election is a guess, the dump is the retail answer, and it only speaks for
  about 2.5 cells per map. Everything else still goes through `map_neighbors`.

- **`interactive_objects_templates`** is keyed by layer-2 gfx id and unions the
  dump's `interactive_objects_data` (respawn, duration) with the 1.29 bundle's
  `IO` table (name, type, skill list). The *type* is what the server acts on:
  3 zaap, 5 house door, 6 storage, 10 zaapi.

- **`waypoints`** has no table anywhere in the dump. Zaaps are found by scanning
  every `maps.cells` payload for a layer-2 object whose interactive bit is armed
  and whose gfx maps to `IO` type 3 or 10. The same scan counts 16 523
  interactive cells in the world: 12 226 resources, 1 743 chests, 1 093 house
  doors, 477 workbenches.

- **`houses`** likewise: the dump carries ownership, never geometry. Doors come
  from `houses.json` (`H.d`: mapId → cell → houseId, 1 095 of them), interior
  maps from `H.m` (mapId → houseId), and the arrival cell is *derived* — among a
  house's interiors, the one carrying a `scripted_cells` `TP` back out to the
  door's map is the way in, and the player lands on a walkable diamond-neighbour
  of that exit rather than on it.

  235 houses have no such exit anywhere in the dump and no inside door object
  either. They keep `entry_map_id` NULL and stay shut: closing a door is a
  smaller bug than sealing a player inside one.

### Why the viewport can still be empty

A map draws scenery from per-cell ground/object tiles **plus** a single
background image. Nothing in this project populates `maps.background` — not a
migration, not the dump. Maps that relied on the background render as an empty
viewport even though they are fully playable, and the schema's default spawn
(10300, "Pitons rocheux") is one of them.

8 774 of the 9 358 imported maps do have ground tiles. Start on one of those:

```bash
SPAWN_MAP_ID=7365 just db-seed    # Cité d'Astrub
```

The seed warns when the map you picked will render empty.

## Inspecting the database

```bash
docker exec dofuspixiclient-postgres-1 psql -U dofus -d dofus \
  -c "SELECT count(*) FROM spell_templates"   # 2091
docker exec dofuspixiclient-postgres-1 psql -U dofus -d dofus \
  -c "SELECT id, name, map_id, cell_id FROM players"
```

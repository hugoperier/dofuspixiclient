/**
 * Rolling an item's stats at creation time — the "jets" of Dofus 1.29.
 *
 * `item_templates.effects` stores the 1.29 shape the world importer
 * decodes from `type#param1#param2#param3`, where for a range effect
 * `param1` is the minimum and `param2` the maximum. A template is a
 * recipe, not an item: two Gelano off the same template have different
 * numbers because each instance rolls once, at the moment it is created,
 * and keeps that roll for life.
 *
 * Nothing in this project ever created an item before QA-060, so this is
 * the first roller. `StatsService.computeEquipmentStats` used to read the
 * template and take `param1` — the minimum — for every worn item; it now
 * prefers the instance's stored roll and only falls back to the template
 * for items seeded by hand straight into SQL with an empty `effects`.
 *
 * `param3` is left untouched: on a weapon it holds a dice formula
 * (`1d7+0`) that is not ours to interpret here.

 * `#param1#param2#param3` triple `param1`/`param2` come from. An effect
 * the bundle does *not* mark as a jet — pet bookkeeping (800/806/807/808),

 * carries that shape: it's a bare number ("64", "a", "ca") or an id-typed
 * flag. That difference is already sitting in the data the server has on
 * hand, so this is what tells a roll from a non-roll, without loading the
 * lang bundle just to read one boolean.
 *
 * QA-079: this was previously unconditional on `param2 > param1`, which
 * also matched effect 800 ("Points de vie : #3", param1=5, param2=72 on
 * some pets) and produced a random, permanently-wrong pet HP display.

 *   - a storage needs `EC` **then** `EL`, because
 *     `dofus.datacenter.Storage` has no inventory array until an `EL`
 *     assigns one and every `Es` before that is dropped without a word;
 *   - a trade needs `EC` **alone**, because `onCreate` case 1 builds its
 *     model from the client's own inventory clone and an `EL` would be
 *     read as a storage list.
 *
 * So there are two openers — `open()` and `openTrade()` — and no way to
 * send a bare `EC` by accident on the path that must not have one.

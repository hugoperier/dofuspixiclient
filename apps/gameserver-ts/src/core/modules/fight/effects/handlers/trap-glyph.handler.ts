/**
 * Traps (effect 400) and glyphs (effect 401).
 *
 * Both are *wrappers*: the effect the caster's spell carries has no
 * damage of its own. By 1.29 convention its `min` holds the id of a
 * separate **trigger spell**, which is what actually hurts whoever sets
 * the thing off, and its `areaKind`/`areaSize` describe the zone that
 * triggers it. The cast use-case pre-loads that spell into
 * `scope.triggerSpell`.
 *
 * Everything below flows from getting those two facts right. Reading the
 * wrapper's own `min`/`max` as a damage range means dealing a spell id
 * as neutral damage; testing the wrapper's centre cell instead of its
 * zone means a glyph almost never fires, since the centre is the cell an
 * enemy is least likely to stand on.
